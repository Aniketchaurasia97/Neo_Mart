    question: "How does Trustify ensure safe transactions?",
    answer: "Trustify allows you to buy and sell a variety of items, including electronics, furniture, clothing, and second-hand goods, all within your trusted network. By limiting transactions to verified connections, we reduce the risk of scams and provide a layer of accountability not found on traditional marketplaces."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Trustify different from other marketplaces?",
    answer: "Unlike traditional marketplaces where you deal with strangers, Trustify connects you exclusively with people in your verified networkâ€”friends, colleagues, and trusted contacts. This creates a safer environment for buying and selling items with built-in accountability and trust."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I verify my contacts on Trustify?",
    answer: "Verification happens through mutual confirmation and optional social media integration. When you add a contact, they'll receive a request to confirm your connection. Once confirmed, you can both see each other's listings and engage in transactions."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a fee for using Trustify?",
    answer: "Basic usage of Trustify is free, including listing items and communicating with your network. We charge a small service fee only when a transaction is successfully completed, helping us maintain the platform while keeping it accessible to everyone."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I list an item for sale on Trustify?",
    answer: "Simply tap the 'Sell' button, add photos of your item, write a description, set your price, and choose whether to make it visible to your entire network or specific contacts. Your listing will immediately be visible to your verified connections."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I have an issue with a purchase?",
    answer: "Since transactions happen within your trusted network, most issues can be resolved directly. However, Trustify offers a resolution center where you can report problems and get support from our team if needed. Our goal is to maintain trust within the community."
